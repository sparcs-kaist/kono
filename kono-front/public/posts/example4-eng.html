    Hello, this is KAIST coin karaoke.</br>
    As mentioned earlier, the air conditioner of the coin karaoke is broken.</br>
</p>
<p>
    After looking for a solution, it is said that due to the structural problem of the air conditioner installation method, some structural changes is needed.</br>
    In order to solve this problem, we are planning to close coin karaoke from tomorrow (Saturday, August 10) to next Friday (Friday, August 16).</br>
    Please note that it will be difficult to use coin karaoke during this period.</br>
</p>
<p>
    Thank you.
