    Hello, this is KAIST coin karaoke.</br>
    Currently, the air conditioner in the coin karaoke is malfunctioning and we noticed that users of karaoke are suffering from the inconvenience.</br>
</p>
<p>
    We recognized the situation last Thursday, and we are going to share what we have done to identify and resolve the problem.</br>
    First of all, we requested an inspection to the air conditioning service center this Tuesday and the cause of the malfunction was the flood of the water due to a water drain pump failure. However, it is unnecessary to fix the drain pump because of the size of the access hole to the air conditioner is too small.</br>
    Therefore, the air conditioner will be repaired in addition to the expansion work of the access hole.</br>
    Since the consultation on the construction of the access hole will take place next Monday, it is still difficult to say when it will be repaired but we will try to solve the problem as soon as possible.</br>
    I'm very sorry for the inconvenience of using coin karaoke in the hot summer.</br>
</p>
<p>
    Thank you.</br>
