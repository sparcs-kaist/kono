## Websocket Client and Server for ESP-8266

This is a simple library that implements a Websocket client and server running on an ESP-8266.

### Getting started

The example WebSocketServer.html file should be served from any web server you have access to. Remember to change the  URL in it to your Arduino. The examples are based on using a WiFly wireless card to connect. If you're using ethernet instead you'll need to swap out the client class.

Install the library to "libraries" folder in your Arduino sketchbook folder. For example, on a mac that's `~/Documents/Arduino/libraries`.

Try the examples to ensure that things work.

Start playing with your own code!

### Notes
Inside of the WebSocketServer class there is a compiler directive to turn on support for the older "Hixie76" standard. If you don't need it, leave it off as it greatly increases the memory required.

Because of limitations of the current Arduino platform (Uno at the time of this writing), this library does not support messages larger than 65535 characters. In addition, this library only supports single-frame text frames. It currently does not recognize continuation frames, binary frames, or ping/pong frames.

### Credits
Thank you to github user ejeklint for the excellent starting point for this library. From his original Hixie76-only code I was able to add support for RFC 6455 and create the WebSocket client.
